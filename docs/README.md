## Base URL

`https://api.spacexdata.com`

## Versioning

Each route is individually versioned, see route list below for all avaliable versions. The API can also be pinned to the lastest version with `https://api.spacexdata.com/v5/launches/latest`, but only do this if you're cool with potential breaking changes.

## Authentication

Authentication via api key is required for all destructive routes. This includes all `create`, `update`, and `delete` routes.

Authenticate by passing the header `spacex-key` with your api key. Protected routes return `401` without a valid key.

## Pagination + Custom Queries

All `/query` routes support pagination, custom queries, and other output controls.

See the [pagination + query](queries.md) guide for more details and examples.

## Launch date FAQ's

* **Why does the date appear wrong?** - This is usually due to the way we store and display partial dates in the api. For example, a launch scheduled for `2020 July` would be represented as `2020-07-01T00:00:00.000Z`. In this case, the field `date_precision` would be set as `month`, meaning the date is only valid to the `month` level, or `2020-07`

## Launch date field explanations

* `date_utc` -  UTC launch date/time in ISO 8601 format

* `date_unix` - UTC launch date/time as a UNIX timestamp in seconds

* `date_local` -  Local launch time with time zone offset in ISO 8601 format

* `date_precision` - Gives the date precision for partial dates. Valid values are `quarter`, `half`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`.

* `tbd` - Set as true if date is `To be determined`

* `net` - Set as true if the date is `No earlier than`

## Caching

The api makes use of response caching via Redis for all `GET` requests, and `POST` requests on `/query` endpoints.

Standard cache times are as follows:

**launches** - 20 seconds

**capsules**, **cores**, **launchpads**, **landpads**, **crew**, **ships**, **payloads** - 5 minutes

**dragons**, **rockets** - 24 hours

Cache can be cleared with the following endpoint:

* ðŸ”’ [Clear cache](cache/clear.md) : `DELETE /admin/cache`
